Variable is like a container that holds data. Very similar to how our containers in kitchen holds sugar, salt etc Creating a variable

like creating a placeholder in memory and assigning it some value. In Python its as easy as writing:
String: Strings are sequences of characters and are treated as immutable in Python. They support a wide range of string manipulation operations.
Exception: Exceptions are types of errors that occur when the program is being executed and change the normal flow of the ptogram
Data types: data types are needed to store different types of values in memory
It specifies type of value that variable holds
Data types are needed to do different operations without causing an error


There are inbuilt data types in python
They are:
Numerical datatype
Int
Float
Complex
Boolean: true or false 
List:collect of different items enclosed between square brackets which we canâ€™t change the values
Tuple: tuple is a collection of different elements which we can change the values
Dictionary:collection of key value elements 
Represents values of key elements
